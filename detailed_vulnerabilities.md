# CVE-2024-27316 
HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP 413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this leads to memory exhaustion.

# CVE-2023-43622 
An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known “slow loris” attack pattern.
This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

----------------------------------------------…

# Exploit for Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in Apache Http Server 
No data found.

# CVE-2023-45802 
When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request’s memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During “normal” HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

MySQL-based databases including MySQL, MariaDB and PerconaDB are affected
by a privilege escalation vulnerability which can let attackers who have
gained access to mysql system user to further escalate their privileges
to root user allowing them to fully compromise the system.
The vulnerability stems from unsafe file handling of error logs and
other files.

The error.log file on most default installations of MySQL/PerconaDB/MariaDB
databases is stored either in /var/log/mysql or /var/lib/mysql directory.

The permissions on the file and directory look as follows:

mysqld_safe wrapper that is normally used for starting MySQL daemon and
creating/reopening the error.log performs certain unsafe file operations that
may allow attackers to gain root privileges.

The wrapper script contains a ‘while’ loop shown below which monitors the mysqld
process and performs a restart in case of the process failure.
The restart involves re-creation of the error.log file if syslog logging has
not been configured instead of error log files (file-based logging is the
default setting on most installations).

--------[ mysqld_safe ]--------

As can be seen, the error.log file is created (touch) and chowned to the user
running the mysqld daemon (typically ‘mysql’).

The operation is vulnerable to a symlink attack.

Attackers who obtained access to mysql account, through CVE-2016-6663
vulnerability described at:

http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-RootPrivEsc-CVE-2016-6664-5617-Exploit.html

would gain access to /var/log or /var/lib/mysql directories (owned by mysql user)
and could therefore easily remove the error.log file and replace it
with a symlink to an arbitrary system file and escalate privileges.

The privilege escalation could be triggered instantly (without the need to wait
for mysql service restart/reboot) by attackers having ‘mysql’ account by simply
killing the mysqld child process (launched by the mysqld_safe wrapper).

When the mysqld process gets terminated, the wrapper will then re-itertate the
loop shown above and immediately create a mysql-owned file in the location
specified by the attacker in the symlink thus allowing attackers to quickly
escalate their privileges.

An independent research has revealed a race condition vulnerability which is
present in MySQl, MariaDB and PerconaDB databases.

The vulnerability can allow a local system user with access to the affected
database in the context of a low-privileged account (CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants)
to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system
user (typically ‘mysql’).

Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain access to all of the
databases stored on the affected database server.

The obtained level of access upon the exploitation, could be chained with
the other privilege escalation vulnerabilities discovered by the author of
this advisory (CVE-2016-6662 and CVE-2016-6664) to further escalate privileges
from mysql user to root user and thus allow attackers to fully compromise the
target server.

Table locations

Observing file operations performed on the table stored within the directory,
it was discovered that REPAIR TABLE SQL statement which is available to
low-privileged users with SELECT/CREATE/INSERT grants, performed unsafe
operations on temporary files created during the table repair process.

Executing the statement:

The first call:

was found to check file permissions of poctab1.MYD table which are then copied with chmod()
to the newly created poctab1.TMD temporary file containing the repaired table.

The code is vulnerable to Race Condition between the call:

and

If an attacker managed to unlink the temporary table poctab1.TMD and replace it
with a symlink to /var/lib/mysql before the chmod() operation (i.e. win the race),
they would be able to apply arbitrary permissions on the data directory.
The attacker would be able to control the set of permissions by pre-setting them on
poctab1.MYD file before executing the REPAIR TABLE statement.
For example, by setting the permissions of poctab1.MYD to 777 the data directory
would become readable and writable to the attacker.

# CVE-2020-28912 
With MariaDB running on Windows, when local clients connect to the server over named pipes, it’s possible for an unprivileged user with an ability to run code on the server machine to intercept the named pipe connection and act as a man-in-the-middle, gaining access to all the data passed between the client and the server, and getting the ability to run SQL commands on behalf of the connected user. This occurs because of an incorrect security descriptor. This affects MariaDB Server before 10.1.48, 10.2.x before 10.2.35, 10.3.x before 10.3.26, 10.4.x before 10.4.16, and 10.5.x before 10.5.7.

# CVE-2022-31624 
MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.

# CVE-2022-31623 
MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.
